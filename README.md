# StylometricAnalyser_python
Stylometry is an application of statistical methods for linguistic style analysis. It is often used to attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed works (often in written language) based on the linguistic behaviours or characteristics manifested in the texts. 

One of the classic authorship attribution studies was whether William Shakespeare wrote all his works, in particular one of his popular plays — Henry VI Trilogy — was highly disputed to have been written or co-authored by Christopher Marlowe.

We will implement a simple stylometric analyser to investigate the lin- guistic behaviours of both authors. The analyser is able to perform basic statistical analysis on a number of linguistic features and also present the analysis results using some form of visualisation.

six specific written works were selected from a public available corpus1 — two of which where the authorship was attributed to the specific author; and two other works which were known to be disputed between the two authors (but were attributed to Shakespeare).
